            <strong>Udemy Business Leadership Academy Offering.</strong> By purchasing access to
            Udemy Business Leadership Academy, as specified in the relevant Order Form, Customer
            will receive licenses to access specific learning content (the “
            <strong>Cohort Licenses</strong>”) accessible through an online learning platform (the “
            <strong>Udemy Business Leadership Academy Platform</strong>”) that includes Cohort
            Services (as defined below).
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Udemy Business Leadership Academy Platform.</strong> Customer will be provided
            access to the Udemy Business Leadership Academy Platform, as detailed in the applicable
            Order Form, where Users may access the specific cohort learning content (“
            <strong>Udemy Business Leadership Academy Content</strong>”) and/or any Customer
            proprietary content, materials, and information (“
            <strong>Customer IP</strong>”). Customer may purchase access for additional Udemy
            Business Leadership Academy Platform Users (in excess of those in the applicable Order
            Form), subject to an additional fee and the terms and conditions set forth herein.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Cohort Licenses.</strong> Access to Udemy Business Leadership Academy Content is
            limited to Users with Cohort Licenses and is available for the duration of an applicable
            cohort program (or such other duration agreed between the Parties), each of which shall
            consist of a minimum of 25 participants (the “<strong>Cohort Program</strong>”). The
            Customer will notify Udemy at least a minimum of six weeks prior to the launch of a
            Cohort Program. To the extent a Cohort Program has to be canceled or rescheduled through
            no fault of Udemy (e.g., did not meet the required 25 participants, etc.), Udemy shall
            not have any liability for such cancellation and may charge an additional fee to
            accommodate the rescheduled Cohort Program. Any request to reschedule a Cohort Program
            by Customer requires at least 14 days written notice.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Additional Services.</strong> Optional third-party products (“
            <strong>Vendor Add-ons</strong>”) or additional support services (“
            <strong>Cohort Services</strong>”) may be included with Udemy Business Leadership
            Academy. The availability of the Vendor Add-ons and/or Cohort Services is included with
            Customer's Cohort License at an additional cost per User, which shall be set forth in an
            Order Form. Cohort Services are not available for Customer proprietary content. Any
            additional services requested by Customer will be separately scoped at an additional
            cost.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Customer IP.</strong> Customer represents and warrants that Customer has all
            right, title and interest in and to all Customer IP provided to Udemy to perform the
            Services set forth in the applicable Order Form and shall defend, indemnify, and hold
            harmless Udemy and its Affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and
            agents with respect to any claims against Udemy regarding such Customer IP.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Restrictions on Use of Licenses.</strong> Each Cohort License, once assigned to
            a User, is unique to such User and may not be assigned or shared with any other person
            via shared login or any other method. All Cohort Licenses expire on the one-year
            anniversary date of the issuance of such Cohort Licenses by Udemy and must be renewed
            annually thereafter.
