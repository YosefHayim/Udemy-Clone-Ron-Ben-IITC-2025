                  We may invite you to complete a survey or participate in a

                  through the Services or a third-party platform. If you

                  survey or promotion, the third party’s privacy policy will
                  apply.

          2.1 Cookies and Data Collection Tools
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We use cookies, which are small text files stored by your browser, to
          collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites,
          including on Udemy. They allow us to remember things about your visits
          to Udemy, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to
          use. To learn more about cookies, visit{" "}

        <p className="mb-4">
          Udemy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google
          Analytics and third-party advertisers) use server log files and
          automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts,
          customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons
          (together, <strong>“Data Collection Tools”</strong>) when you access
          and use the Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track
          and collect certain System Data and Usage Data (as detailed in Section
          1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we tie data gathered
          through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as
          described in this Privacy Policy.

        <h3 className="mb-4 text-lg font-bold">
          2.2 Why We Use Data Collection Tools
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Udemy uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the
          purposes described:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-4 pl-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Strictly Necessary:</strong> These Data Collection Tools
            enable you to access the site, provide basic functionality (like
            logging in or accessing content), secure the site, protect against
            fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use
            of your account. These are required for the Services to work
            properly, so if you disable them, parts of the site will break or be
            unavailable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functional:</strong> These Data Collection Tools remember
            data about your browser and your preferences, provide additional
            site functionality, customize content to be more relevant to you,
            and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the
            Services (like your preferred language or volume level for video
            playback).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance:</strong> These Data Collection Tools help
            measure and improve the Services by providing usage and performance
            data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an application was
            downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions of
            Udemy to see which features or content users prefer and determine
            which email messages are opened.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising:</strong> These Data Collection Tools are used
            to deliver relevant ads (on the site and/or other sites) based on
            things we know about you like your Usage and System Data (as
            detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers
            know about you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on
            your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites
            and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide
            these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your
            email address (in a human-readable form) and content that you share
            publicly on the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Media:</strong> These Data Collection Tools enable
            social media functionality, like sharing content with friends and
            networks. These cookies may track a user or device across other
            sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted advertising
            purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place
          cookies on your computer, limit the type of cookies you allow, or
          refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be able to use some
          or all features of the Services, and your experience may be different
          or less functional. To learn more about managing Data Collection

          We recognize the privacy interests of children and encourage parents

          live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), may not set up an
          account, but may have a parent or guardian open an account and help
          them access appropriate content. Individuals younger than the required

          learn that we’ve collected personal data from a child under those
          ages, we will take reasonable steps to delete it.
