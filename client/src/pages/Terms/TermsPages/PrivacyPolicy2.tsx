                    Udemy and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third-party

                <p className="mb-4">
                    Udemy uses the following types of Data Collection Tools for the purposes described:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strictly Necessary:</strong> These Data Collection Tools enable you to access the
                        site, provide basic functionality (like logging in or accessing content), secure the site,
                        protect against fraudulent logins, and detect and prevent abuse or unauthorized use of your
                        account. These are required for the Services to work properly, so if you disable them, parts
                        of the site will break or be unavailable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Functional:</strong> These Data Collection Tools remember data about your browser
                        and your preferences, provide additional site functionality, customize content to be more
                        relevant to you, and remember settings affecting the appearance and behavior of the Services
                        (like your preferred language or volume level for video playback).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Performance:</strong> These Data Collection Tools help measure and improve the
                        Services by providing usage and performance data, visit counts, traffic sources, or where an
                        application was downloaded from. These tools can help us test different versions of Udemy to
                        see which features or content users prefer and determine which email messages are opened.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Advertising:</strong> These Data Collection Tools are used to deliver relevant ads
                        (on the site and/or other sites) based on things we know about you like your Usage and
                        System Data (as detailed in Section 1), and things that the ad service providers know about
                        you based on their tracking data. The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity
                        over time and across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may
                        provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in
                        a human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Social Media:</strong> These Data Collection Tools enable social media
                        functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks. These cookies may track a
                        user or device across other sites and build a profile of user interests for targeted
                        advertising purposes.

                    You can set your web browser to alert you about attempts to place cookies on your computer,
                    limit the type of cookies you allow, or refuse cookies altogether. If you do, you may not be

                    guardian open an account and help them access appropriate content. Individuals younger than
                    the required age for consent to use online services may not use the Services. If we learn that
                    we’ve collected personal data from a child under those ages, we will take reasonable steps to
