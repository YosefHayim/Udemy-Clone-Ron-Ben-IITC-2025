          This Udemy Business Privacy Statement was updated on September 6, 2024.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In the course of providing Udemy Business (<strong>“UB”</strong>) services and related
          services to its corporate, non-profit organization, and governmental customers (
          <strong>“Customers”</strong>
          ), Udemy will receive and have access to personal data of individual users to whom
          customers grant access (<strong>“Users”</strong>). For the purposes of this privacy
          statement, Customers are data controllers and Udemy is a data processor. Udemy’s
          processing of User data and the security measures implemented to protect such data are
          detailed in and governed by a written agreement between Udemy and each of its Customers.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As a data processor, Udemy will access, store and use the personal data of individual
          Users solely for the purpose of providing the UB services to its Customers and will
          process the data as instructed by its Customers.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          As data controllers, Customers decide which of their employees or other authorized persons
          are given access to the UB services. They do this by designating one or more UB account
          administrators or group administrators (<strong>“Administrator”</strong>) who act on
          behalf of the Customer and have the ability to customize the Customer account, manage
          individual User accounts, access the UB Insights tool and related reporting features,
          access the UB Administrator tools, and populate the Customer account with
          Customer-provided content. Customers are solely responsible for establishing policies for
          and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, relating to the
          collection of personal information relating to individual Users selected by Customers for
          accessing the UB services. Udemy has no direct relationship with individual Users, who
          should contact Customers (their organization) for assistance with any requests or
          questions relating to the processing of their personal information.
        </p>

          1. Information about Users collected and stored by Udemy
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-inside list-decimal space-y-4 text-sm">
          <li>
            When a User is given access to the UB services by the Administrator, a User may set up
            an individual User account and Udemy will collect information provided by the User or
            the Administrator. The Customer can customize the type of data requested to create an
            account, which may include the following:
            <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
              <li>Email address (required)</li>
              <li>First and last name</li>
              <li>
                Profile photo, areas of interest, job skills, goals, and role (optionally provided
                by User or Customer)
              </li>
              <li>Other personal data, as allowed by the Customer</li>
            </ul>
            A unique identifying number is assigned by Udemy upon the creation of a User account.
            User profile pages may be viewable by other Users in the same UB organization but are
            not viewable by individuals outside of the organization. Administrators may assign a
            User to a group membership.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers may choose to integrate UB with a Single Sign On (SSO) identity provider to
            enable Users to log in to UB User accounts without the need to disclose hashed passwords
            to Udemy. Users may log in by providing their individual SSO credentials to the SSO
            identity provider, which will authenticate them and allow or deny access to the Customer
            account. SSO identity providers share with Udemy authentication information about the
            User as an authorized user of Customer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers may choose whether Administrators and Users can interact with others
            (including with instructors, teaching assistants, and other students) by posting reviews
            about educational content, messaging or chatting, posting questions or answers, or
            posting other content. Posted content is stored by Udemy and may be publicly available
            or viewable by others, including Administrators, Users, or instructors and teaching
            assistants, depending on where the content is posted.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the option of the Customer, Administrators may enable the ability to “Share to
            Slack.” This feature allows Users to manually or automatically post a message to the
            Customer’s own instance of the Slack messaging service. To enable this optional
            functionality, Customer’s Slack administrators must grant Udemy the ability to read the
            full list of public channels, private channels, and users in the Customer’s Slack
            instance. These lists may include individuals in Customer’s Slack instance who are not
            UB Users. Slack user lists and channels are briefly cached before being automatically
            purged from Udemy’s systems. Information from Slack is used to deliver the Services and
            is not used for any other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Udemy stores information relating to the activities of Users as they use and interact
            with the UB services, such as content viewed, searched for, or accessed (and information
            relating to that content); interactions with instructors, teaching assistants,
            Administrators, moderators (in the case of Leadership Academy), and other Users; as well
            as answers, essays, and other items submitted by Users to satisfy the educational
            content requirements. This information is linked to a User’s unique account ID and is
            shared with Customers via the Customer account reporting tools or upon request of the
            Customer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customers may have the option to enable features that are powered by generative
            artificial intelligence (GenAI). Customer personal data is not used to train or
            fine-tune GenAI models used for the benefit of other Customers. Leadership Academy users
            may have their cohort discussions summarized by GenAI.
          </li>
          <li>
            The UB service enables Users to contact the Udemy Support Team for assistance or report
            a problem, concern, potential abuse, or other issues regarding the UB services or other
            Users. Udemy may collect and store the User’s name, email address, operating system, IP
            address as well as the User’s activity on the Udemy platform and communications with the
            Udemy help desk team. Udemy may request additional information from Users in order to
            resolve any issue reported by a User or by another user.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a User uses the UB services, Udemy collects and stores certain information by
            automated means: (a) technical information about the User’s computer or wireless device,
            such as IP address, operating system, type and version of device, ID, browser, browser
            language, domain, and other operating system or platform information. This information
            is collected through the use of server log files and tracking technologies; and (b)
            cookies, which are small files that websites send to a computer or wireless device to
            uniquely identify a browser or mobile device or to store information in a browser
            setting; and (ii) other tracking technologies (see below for more detailed information).
          </li>
          <li>
            IP addresses received from browsers or devices of Users may be used to determine the
            approximate location of Users.

          Like many online platforms, Udemy uses server log files and automated data collection
          tools, such as browser cookies and scripts. Cookies are small text files placed onto a

          customizing a user’s view or remembering a user’s preferences; and measure site, service,
          or feature usage. Udemy may tie the information collected by these means to the unique

          with a number of third-party service providers. These third parties are contractually
          required to use User data solely as directed by Udemy for the purpose of providing
          services to Udemy. Administrators of existing Customers are able to access our list of
          current sub-processors on the left sidebar of this page while logged in to UB.

            Instructors who upload content on the Udemy platform, as well as their teaching

          <li>
            Udemy’s help center platform vendor hosts and stores all communications between
            Administrators or Users and the Udemy Support Team. The help center vendor is
            contractually required to store and process User related data solely as directed by
            Udemy for the purpose of providing services to Udemy. Udemy also partners with a chat
            messaging vendor to provide support to Users and Administrators, to collect feedback,
            and to display in-app messages for feature announcements or onboarding new users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Udemy shares User information with third-party companies that perform email services to
            enable Udemy to send email communications to Users and to manage email preference
            settings of Users.
          </li>
          <li>
            For Leadership Academy Users, certain features like chat rooms, message boards, news
            groups, or other public forums are available and visible to other participants, so
            confidential or proprietary information should only be shared in accordance with their
            organization’s standards.

        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our servers and subprocessors are located in the United States. In order to provide the
          Services to you, we may transfer and process your data there. If personal data processed
