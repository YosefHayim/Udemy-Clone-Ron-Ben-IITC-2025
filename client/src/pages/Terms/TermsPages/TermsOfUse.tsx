          previously purchased is disabled for certain legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to

          described below. On occasion, a third party may be necessary to help resolve our dispute.

          informal dispute resolution process. The claiming party shall send a short, written
          statement (“Claim Statement”) explaining the dispute and a proposal for resolving it to

          As an alternative to small claims court, you and Udemy can resolve disputes through
          individual arbitration. While there’s no judge or jury in arbitration, the arbitrator has
          the power to award the same relief as a court. You and Udemy agree to arbitration as the
          sole alternative for resolving disputes.

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.5 General Arbitration Rules</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          All arbitrations shall be before a single arbitrator. Disputes involving less than $15,000
          USD in damages must be resolved through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration. For
          other disputes, arbitrations may be conducted by phone, video, or written submissions.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.6 Mass Arbitration Rules</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          If 25 or more claimants file demands for arbitration against Udemy regarding substantially
          identical disputes, a bellwether procedure will apply to resolve initial cases and guide
          resolution of others. Mass Arbitration rules ensure fairness and consistency in such
          cases.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.7 Fees and Costs</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          Each party will bear its own costs and attorney fees unless otherwise required by law or
          if the claim is found to be frivolous or brought in bad faith.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.8 No Class Actions</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          You and Udemy agree that claims may only be brought individually, not as part of a class
          or representative action. Arbitrators cannot preside over class actions or combine claims
          of multiple individuals.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.9 Changes</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          If Udemy updates this Dispute Resolution section, you may reject changes by notifying
          Udemy in writing within 30 days of the update. If you reject changes, disputes will be
          handled under the prior version of these terms.
        </p>

        <h4 className="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">11.10 Improperly Commenced Arbitration</h4>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
          If arbitration is improperly initiated, the responding party may seek a court order to
          enjoin the arbitration and recover fees or costs incurred.
