        <p>
          As an instructor, you are contracting directly with Udemy, Inc. (a Delaware corporation in

          Submitted Content. Violations of Udemy’s terms and policies by your co-instructor or
          teaching assistant may also impact your Udemy account and Submitted Content. Udemy is not
          able to advise on any questions or mediate any disputes between you and such users. If

          (collectively, “Instructor Programs”). These programs can help increase your revenue
          potential on Udemy and do not require any up-front cost to participate. You can modify
          your participation status, though certain programs restrict when modifications can be made

        {/* Subsection 4.2: Price Setting */}
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">4.2 Price Setting</h3>
        <p>
          When creating Submitted Content available for purchase on Udemy, you will be prompted to
          select a base price (“Base Price”) for your Submitted Content from a list of available
          price tiers. Alternatively, you may choose to offer your Submitted Content for free. As a
          premium instructor, you will also be given the opportunity to participate in Promotional
          Programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not opt to participate in any Promotional Programs, we will list your Submitted
          Content for the Base Price or the closest local or mobile app equivalent (as detailed
          below). If you opt to participate in a Promotional Program, we may set a different
          discounted price or list price for your Submitted Content as described in the Promotions
          Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a student purchases using a foreign currency, we will convert the relevant Base Price
          or Promotional Program price into the student’s applicable currency using a system-wide
          foreign currency conversion rate set by Udemy and fixed periodically into a table of
          corresponding price tiers by currency (“Price Tier Matrix”). Since the Price Tier Matrix
          is fixed, those conversion rates may not be identical to the applicable market rate in
          effect when a transaction is processed. We reserve the right to update the Price Tier
          Matrix at any time. The Price Tier Matrix and additional information on Udemy’s pricing
          tiers are available{' '}
          <a href="/pricing-tiers" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">

          .
        </p>
        <p>
          When a student purchases through a mobile application, the mobile platform provider’s
          pricing matrix will control, and we will choose the price tier closest to the applicable
          Base Price or Promotional Program price. Because mobile platforms impose their own
          currency conversion rates, conversions for mobile app prices may not match the conversions
          in the Price Tier Matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          You give us permission to share your Submitted Content for free with our employees, with
          selected partners, and in cases where we need to restore access to customers who have
          previously purchased your Submitted Content. You understand that you will not receive
          compensation in these cases.

        <p>
          If a student purchases a product or service in a country that requires Udemy to remit
          national, state, or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes (VAT), or other similar
          transaction taxes (“Transaction Taxes”), under applicable law, we will collect and remit
          those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those sales. We may increase
          the sale price at our discretion where we determine that such taxes may be due. For
          purchases through mobile applications, applicable Transaction Taxes are collected by the
          mobile platform (such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play).

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">5.1 Revenue Share</h3>
        <p>
          When a student purchases your Submitted Content, we calculate the gross amount of the sale
          as the amount actually received by Udemy from the student (“Gross Amount”). From this, we
          subtract any Transaction Taxes, any mobile platform fees applied to mobile provider
          checkout sales, a 3% fee for any non-mobile payment method in Japan, where we substantiate
          a fee paid to any non-mobile provider checkout sales, and any amounts paid to third
          parties in connection with the Inclusion Programs to calculate the net amount of the sale
          (“Net Amount”).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you opt into any of Udemy’s optional Instructor Programs, the relevant revenue share
          may be different and will be detailed in the Promotions Policy or Instructor Guide Policy.
          By default, your revenue share will be 37% of the Net Amount less any applicable
          deductions, such as student refunds, which we will process at our discretion.
        </p>

          To get your payment report, you can access the relevant revenue share data by month as
