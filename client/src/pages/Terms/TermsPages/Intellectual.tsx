          This Intellectual Property Policy was last updated on November 4, 2021.

        <p>
          Udemy is a technology platform that enables anyone anywhere to create and share
          educational content. We host hundreds and thousands of courses on our online learning
          marketplace. Our marketplace model means we don’t review or edit the content for legal
          issues, and we aren’t in a position to determine the legality of the content. However,
          Udemy respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects instructors on Udemy
          to do the same. When instructors post content on Udemy, they make the promise that they
          have the necessary authorization or rights to use that content.
        </p>
        <p>Infringing activity is not tolerated on or through our platform.</p>
        <p>
          This policy addresses what we do in the event of copyright takedown notices from content
          owners and trademark takedown notices from trademark owners with respect to the content on
          the Udemy platform. The policy also addresses what we do when Udemy instructors’ courses
          are copied on third-party platforms without their consent.

          Udemy’s policy is to remove content from our service when it is reported as infringing in
          a copyright takedown notice received from the owner of the original content. It’s also our
          policy to remove all content from any instructor who’s determined to be a repeat infringer
          (for whom Udemy has received more than two valid copyright takedown notices). We reserve
          the right to terminate an instructor’s account at any time, including when they post
          content in violation of the copyrights of others.

          How to File a Copyright Takedown Notice
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you’d like to report content on the Udemy platform and if you are the owner or the
          designated agent of the owner of the rights to the content that you believe the content is
          infringing, the most efficient way is to use this copyright complaint form (form in
          English only). You may also submit notices of alleged copyright infringement to our
          designated copyright agent, identified below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Before you submit a copyright takedown notice, please remember these important things:
          </strong>
        </p>
        <ol className="ml-6 list-decimal space-y-3">
          <li>
            We cannot process a copyright claim that is not submitted by the owner of the copyright
            or its designated agent. This is because we have no way of knowing whether the
            instructor who published the content you are reporting has received proper permission
            from the owner to use the content. We’ll ask you to provide an electronic signature to
            confirm that you’re the copyright owner or have authority to represent the copyright
            owner (including if the copyright owner is an organization). If you don’t own the
            content that you’re reporting, you’re welcome to reach out to the owner and provide them
            with Udemy’s copyright complaint form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knowingly submitting a false or misleading copyright takedown notice is illegal and you
            could be held liable and have to pay damages as a result. Udemy reserves the right to
            seek damages from anyone who submits a notification of claimed infringement in violation
            of the law.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consider whether the use of your material in the content is “fair use.” Copyright law
            includes a “fair use” exception for certain uses of copyrighted content that are
            considered to be in the public interest. Before you submit a copyright claim, make sure
            that use of the copied content does not qualify as fair use. Fair use covers things like
            criticism, commentary, news reporting, and research. In considering whether the
            content’s use of your material qualifies as fair use, you should look at:
            <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
              <li>
                The purpose of the use (whether the content is paid or unpaid, whether the content
                critiques/parodies/transforms your material).
              </li>
              <li>
                The type of copyrighted work being used (whether your work is factual or creative).
              </li>
              <li>
                The portion being used (whether the content uses small, necessary excerpts of your
                material or substantial portions of it).
              </li>
              <li>
                The effect on the market for your material (whether potential buyers would purchase
                the content instead of your material).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            There are types of content that aren’t protected by copyright. Copyright law doesn’t
            cover short phrases (like business names, book titles, and slogans), intangible concepts
            (like processes, ideas, and recipes), or facts. Before you submit a copyright claim,
            make sure that the copied content is indeed protected by copyright. If you need to
            report a trademark violation, please follow the steps outlined in the How to Submit a
            Trademark Takedown Notice section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your copyright claim has to be sufficiently substantiated for us to be able to address
            it. This means:
            <ul className="ml-6 list-disc space-y-2">
              <li>
                You provide sufficient information for us to contact you, including your full legal
                name, an email address, physical address, and (optional) telephone number.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you’re filing a notice on behalf of an organization, you include the name of the
                organization and your relationship to the organization.
              </li>
              <li>
                You precisely identify the original copyrighted material or, if multiple copyrighted
                works are covered in your notification, you provide a sufficiently representative
                list of such original material (such as a URL where the material is located).
              </li>
              <li>
                You provide sufficient information for us to locate the reportedly infringing
                content on the Udemy platform (the URL on our website and the exact name of the
                course and instructor).
              </li>
              <li>
                You add a statement saying: “I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the
                information in this complaint is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am
                authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf and I have a good faith belief
                that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
                copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”
              </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
          If we receive a valid copyright takedown notice, we’ll send a copy of that notice to the
          instructor who posted the reported content along with a notification that: (1) the content
          was reported for copyright infringement and (2) we’re removing the content from the Udemy
          platform. We’ll also attach a form that the instructor can fill in and send back to us to
          submit a counter-notification. If your content has been reported for copyright
          infringement and removed from the Udemy platform, and if you believe we made a mistake or
          that you have permission from the owner of the reported content to use such content, then
          you may send us a counter-notification.

          Knowingly submitting a false or misleading counter-notification to a claim of infringement

          The best way to provide us with a counter-notification is to fill in the form we provided
          you and send it back to the Udemy designated agent or the copyright team member who

          <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
          <li>Your name, address, and email address or telephone number;</li>
          <li>
            Identification of the content that was removed and the location (URL) at which it
            appeared before it was removed (you can access this information from the copyright
            takedown notice filed against your content; we always attach a copy when we notify you);
          </li>
          <li>
            A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material

            be removed or disabled; and
          </li>

            A statement that you consent to: (i) Udemy sharing your name and contact information
            with the claimant; (ii) receiving service of process for any legal action by the
            claimant or an agent of the claimant; and (iii) accepting the jurisdiction of the

            Consider whether the use of your trademark in the content is “fair use.” Trademark law
            protects the use of a name or brand for selling products and services, with the goal of
            preventing consumer confusion. Most countries’ laws include an exception for “fair use,”
            which allows others to use a trademark for factually referencing the trademarked product
            or service, or commenting on or criticizing the mark. Consider the likelihood that
            others would be confused into thinking that your company or brand had created or is
            sponsoring the content. Before you submit a trademark claim, make sure that use of your
            trademark in the content does not qualify as fair use.
