                    Udemy is a technology platform that enables anyone anywhere to create and
                    share educational content. We host hundreds and thousands of courses on our
                    online learning marketplace. Our marketplace model means we don’t review or
                    edit the content for legal issues, and we aren’t in a position to determine
                    the legality of the content. However, Udemy respects the intellectual
                    property rights of others and expects instructors on Udemy to do the same.
                    When instructors post content on Udemy, they make the promise that they have
                    the necessary authorization or rights to use that content.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Infringing activity is not tolerated on or through our platform.
                </p>
                <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    This policy addresses what we do in the event of copyright takedown notices
                    from content owners and trademark takedown notices from trademark owners with
                    respect to the content on the Udemy platform. The policy also addresses what
                    we do when Udemy instructors’ courses are copied on third-party platforms
                    without their consent.

                    infringing in a copyright takedown notice received from the owner of the
                    original content. It’s also our policy to remove all content from any
                    instructor who’s determined to be a repeat infringer (for whom Udemy has
                    received more than two valid copyright takedown notices). We reserve the
                    right to terminate an instructor’s account at any time, including when they
                    post content in violation of the copyrights of others.
