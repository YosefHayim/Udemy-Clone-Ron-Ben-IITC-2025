      <b>About me</b>
      <p>
        My name is Hussein and I’m a software engineer. My software journey
        started around 1998 when my uncle gave me a book titled `Learn
        Programming and Visual Basic 2.0`. That book made me realized that I
        enjoy the craft of building software. Using every medium available I
        would talk about software in a form of bulletin boards, blogs, books,
        courses, podcasts, and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I run a YouTube channel where I cover software engineering
        topics with a focus on backend tech. I discuss databases, proxies,
        security, networking, protocols, and programming. I also cover recent
        news and current events in the field of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in the field of geographic information systems (or GIS for
        short). Since 2005, I helped many organizations in the Middle East
        implement Esri GIS by designing and building mapping apps to streamline
        their workflows. I wrote five books on Esri’s technologies and I've been
        a principal engineer there since 2015.

      <p>
        Using software to solve interesting problems is one of the fascinating
        things I really enjoy. Feel free to contact me on my social media
        channels to ask questions or share interesting problems. I would love to
        hear it!
